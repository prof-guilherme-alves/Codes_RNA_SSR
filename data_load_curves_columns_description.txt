Description of the columns of the load curve data files

- Hora: Load curve time (for identification only)

Input Variables:

- Fator: Load scaling factor applied to the nominal system load (e.g., 0.70 to 1.00)
- G1: Active power generation of generator group 1 
- G2: Active power generation of generator group 2  
- G3: Active power generation of generator group 3  
- Pd: Total active load of the system  
- Qd: Total reactive load of the system  

Output Variables â€“ SSR boundary coordinates:

These are grouped by generator group (G1, G2, G3), and each group has 8 coordinates representing the boundary of the Static Security Region (SSR) under a specific security limit (e.g., Reactive Power Limit, Voltage Limit, etc.).

- G11 to G18: 8 SSR coordinates for Generator Group 1
- G21 to G28: 8 SSR coordinates for Generator Group 2
- G31 to G38: 8 SSR coordinates for Generator Group 3

Each row of the dataset corresponds to a time of the daily load curve (system operating point), and the output columns define the boundary of the SSR for that point.
